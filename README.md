# 🌍 Webscraper Emission

This project is a simple **web scraper** in Python that collects data on **annual carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions by country** from Wikipedia. The data is processed into a `pandas.DataFrame` and can be analyzed or visualized using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

## 📌 Features
- Automatic extraction of CO₂ emission tables from Wikipedia.
- Conversion of raw HTML tables into structured `pandas.DataFrame`.
- Basic data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Data visualization with bar charts and comparisons between countries.

## 🛠️ Requirements
The project was built with Python 3.9+.  
Required libraries:
- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

## 📊 Example Results
- Ranking of countries by CO₂ emissions.
- Comparative bar plots of emissions.
- Basic insights into global CO₂ contributions.

## 📄 Data Source
Data is collected from Wikipedia:
